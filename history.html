	<h1>History</h1>
	
	<p>ITB first opened in 1999 and is a third level institution. It was of a 75 million euro investment and to this day, new changes are happening to the college. It was the last-founded Institute of Technology in Ireland. When ITB first opened, it only had one building on site but now there is multiple buildings with a new one being constructed as of now. It only had four courses available but now it has many courses in full-time and part-time. The first higher certificate rewards arrived in 2001. The original logo was different from the one now as it used to be red and green. The logo ITB has now, arrived in 2006. From 1999 to 2006, there was no digital media to help market ITB which made it more difficult. In 2006, ITB achieved delegated authority in 2006 and has the authority to award qualifications to those completing courses up to Level 9. Technical University Dublin started in 2012 and in 2018, legislation passed for ITB to become TUD (Technical University Dublin).</p>
